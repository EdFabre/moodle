      <td height="17"><p>In previous topics, you learned how SAS determines whether 
          sequential access or direct access is likely to be most efficient for 
          WHERE processing. You also learned about a variety of factors that you 
          can assess to determine which access method is most efficient. Once 
          you have made your determination, you can use the following guidelines 
          to decide whether it is efficient to create an index. 
		  <p><br>
        <h2>Guidelines for Deciding Whether to Create an Index</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Minimize the number of indexes to reduce disk storage and update 
            costs. Create indexes only on variables that are often used in queries 
            or (when data cannot be sorted) in BY-group processing.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Create an index when you intend to retrieve a small subset of observations 
            from a large data file.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Do not create an index if the data file's page count is less than 
            three pages. It is faster to access the data sequentially.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Create indexes on variables that are discriminating. Discriminating 
            variables have many different values that precisely identify observations. 
            A WHERE expression that subsets based on a discriminating variable 
            results in a smaller subset than a WHERE expression that references 
            a non-discriminating variable (a variable that has only a few values).<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>To reduce the number of I/O operations that are performed when you 
            create an index, first sort the data by the key variable. Then, to 
            improve performance, maintain the data file in sorted order by the 
            key variable.<br>
            <br>
            <table border="0" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0">
              <tr> 
                <td valign="top" width="24"><img src="../navimages/note.gif" width="20" height="20" alt="Note"></td>
                <td valign="top">If you choose not to use an index and the data 
                  set is large, it is still more efficient to sort the data set 
                  on the <nobr>variable(s)</nobr> that are specified in the WHERE 
                  statement.</td>
              </tr>
            </table>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Consider how often your applications use an index. An index must 
            be used often in order to compensate for the resources that are used 
            in creating and maintaining it.<br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>Consider the cost of an index for a data file that is frequently 
            changed. <br>
            <br>
          </li>
          <li>When you create an index to process a WHERE expression, do not try 
            to create one index that is used to satisfy all queries.</li>
