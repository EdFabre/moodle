            Editor in SAS Enterprise Guide. Now let's see how you can use the 
            point-and-click tasks in SAS Enterprise Guide to do some of the programming 
            for you. </p>
          <p>SAS Enterprise Guide has tasks for many of the SAS procedures that 
            you use in your programs. These tasks enable you to quickly and easily 
            select variables and options to run a procedure. However, not all 
            options available in a SAS procedure are available through the point-and-click 
            task window. You can save time by letting the task generate the basic 
            code and then, if necessary, editing the code to include additional 
            options. <br>
