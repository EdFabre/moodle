          Although it is possible to produce identical results with a DATA step 
          match-merge and a PROC SQL join, these two processes will not always 
          produce results that are identical by default. These two techniques 
          work differently. In order to decide which technique you should use 
          in a particular situation, you should carefully consider both the data 
          that you want to combine and the results that you want to produce. 
        <P>Let's take a look at some simplified examples to see how each method 
          works in various circumstances. </td>
