          data sets, all input data sets must have a common variable. Although

          and <strong>Sasuser.Expenses</strong> do not have a common BY variable, 
          there are several variables that are common to <strong>two of the three</strong> 
          data sets. As shown below, <code>Date</code> and <code>FlightID</code> 
          are both common to <strong>Revenue</strong> and <strong>Expenses</strong>. 
          The variable <code>Code</code> in the <strong>Acities</strong> data 
          set and the variable <code>Dest</code> in the <strong>Revenue</strong> 
          data set are also common variables.</p></td>

          even though they have different names. When you are looking for common 
          variables between data sets, the variable names are not important since 
          they can be changed with the RENAME= option in the MERGE statement. 
          Instead, you should look for variables that record the same information 
          and that have the same type in each input data set. Common variables 
          do not need to have the same length, although you should remember that 
          the length of the variable in the first-listed data set will determine 
          the length of the variable in the output data set.

              but do not have identical types, ERROR and WARNING messages are 
              written to the SAS log, and the match-merge fails.</td>

          In this case, both <code>Code</code> in <strong>Acities</strong> and

        <P> Since there are variables that are common to two different pairs of 
          the three data sets shown above, you can combine these data sets into 
          one data set by using the MERGE statement in two subsequent DATA steps. 
          That is, you can perform one match-merge on two of the data sets to 
          create one new data set that combines information from the two. Then 
          you can perform another match-merge on the new data set and the remaining 
          original data set. Let's take a closer look.</td>
