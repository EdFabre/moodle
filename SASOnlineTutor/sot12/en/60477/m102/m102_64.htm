            in a variable. One way that you can use a format in a summary table 
            is to apply a style to a table cell based on the value of the data 
            in that cell. This is called <strong>traffic lighting</strong>. Traffic 
            lighting is a visual cue that often uses the colors of a traffic light: 
            red, yellow, and green. When you use traffic lighting, you can see 
            at a glance which values are within specifically defined ranges.</p>
          <p>Suppose you want a summary table that shows the total profit that 
            is generated by each product in your specialty foods shop. Over the 
            years you have determined the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Products that generate less than $200 profit in a quarter might 
              need to be discontinued. </li>

              need extra promotion to boost sales. </li>
            <li>Products that generate over $600 per quarter are selling well.</li>
