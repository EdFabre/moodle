      <td> <p>Another way to save disk space is to leave your data in its original 
          location and use a SAS data view to access it. Before looking at working 
          with data views, let's look at what a SAS data view is and how 
          it compares to a SAS data file. 
        <p>A SAS data file and a SAS data view are both types of SAS data sets. 
          The first type, a SAS data file, contains both descriptor information 
          about the data and the data values. The second type, a SAS data view, 
          contains only descriptor information about the data and instructions 
          on how to retrieve data values that are stored elsewhere.

</center>
		<p><br>
          The main difference between SAS data files and SAS data views is where 
          the data values are stored. A SAS data file contains the data values, 
          and a SAS data view does not contain the values. Therefore, data views 
          can be particularly useful if you are working with data values that 
          change often. 
        <p>Suppose you have a flat file that you read into a SAS data file. If 
          the values in the flat file change, you need to update the data file 
          in order to reflect those changes so that you access the correct values 
          when you reference the data file. However, suppose you use a data view 
          to access the values in your flat file instead of reading those values 
          into a data file. You do not need to update the data view when the values 
          in your flat file change, because each time you reference the view it 
          will execute and access the most recent values in your flat file. 
        <p>In most cases, you can use a SAS data view as if it were a SAS data 
          file, although there are a few things to keep in mind when you are working 
          with data views.
