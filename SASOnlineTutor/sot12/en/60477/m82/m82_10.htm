      <td> Compressing your data files is another method that you can use to conserve data storage space.
	 Compressing a data file is a process that reduces the 
        number of bytes that are required in order to represent each observation 
        in a data file. 
        <p>Reading from or writing to a compressed file during data processing 
          requires fewer I/O operations because there are fewer data set pages 
          in a compressed data file. However, in order to read a compressed file, 
          each observation must be uncompressed. This requires more CPU resources 
          than reading an uncompressed file. Also, in some cases, compressing 
          a file might actually increase its size rather than decreasing it.</p>
        <p>Before examining how to compress a data file, let's review the structure 
          of an uncompressed data file as compared to the structure of a compressed 
          data file.</p>
        <P><BR> <h2>Review of Uncompressed Data File Structure</h2>
	  By default, a SAS data file is not compressed. In uncompressed data files, 
        <ul>
          <li>each data value of a particular variable occupies the same number 
            of bytes as any other data value of that variable.<br>
            <br>
          <li>each observation occupies the same number of bytes as any other 
            observation.<br>
            <br>
          <li>character values are padded with blanks. <br>
            <br>
          <li>numeric values are padded with binary zeros.<br>
            <br>
          <li>there is a 16-byte overhead at the beginning of each page. <br>
            <br>
          <li>there is a 1-bit per observation overhead (rounded up to the nearest 
            byte) at the end of each page; this bit denotes an observation's status 
            as deleted or not deleted. <br>
            <br>
          <li>new observations are added at the end of the file. If a new observation 
            won't fit on the current last page of the file, a whole new data set 
            page is added. <br><br>
          <li> the descriptor portion of the data file is stored at the end of 
            the first page of the file. 
        </ul>
