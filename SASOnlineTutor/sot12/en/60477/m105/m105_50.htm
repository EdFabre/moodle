        <td> <p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
          <p>There is variability in every product; no two products are ever identical. 
            One of the primary goals of quality improvement is to understand and 
            reduce process variability. In order to assess variability, you collect 
            samples at rational subgroups (usually time periods). The subgroups 
            are defined such that </p>
          <ul>
            <li>between-sample variability identifies potential problems</li>
            <li>within-sample variability corresponds to the variability inherent 
              in the process.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Control charts such as XBar and S charts can be used to monitor sample 
            variability. These charts can reveal </p>
          <ul>
            <li>a cyclic pattern in sample means, such as seasonal effects </li>
            <li>a pattern suggesting that your samples come from two different 
              processes, such as two work shifts </li>
            <li>a shift in the process at a point in time, perhaps when a new 
              element was added to the process or servicing was conducted </li>
            <li>a gradual increase or decrease in the process level, such as deterioration 
              of mechanical parts. </li>
          </ul>
          <p>In addition to revealing patterns between samples, control charts 
            can also help you detect variation within samples. For example, S 
            and R charts allow you to identify changes in within-sample variability 
            at a particular point in time.</p>
          This example uses a data table that includes information about the temperature 
          of frozen desserts when they arrive at a store on a refrigerated delivery 
          truck. The example shows how to navigate and generate control charts 
          for the mean, the range, and the standard deviation, and how to apply 
          tests for special causes to the control charts.
