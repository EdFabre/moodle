        <p>SAS Enterprise Guide saves the layout of your workspace so that it opens 
          with the same window arrangement that you used when you exited the software. 
          In addition, you can change elements of the workspace in the <strong>Customize</strong> 
          window. </p>
        <p>The Customize window enables you to control toolbars, the Tools menu, 
          shortcut keys, and editor keys. To open the Customize window, select<strong> 
          Tools<img src="../navimages/arrow.gif" width="14" height="10" alt="then">Customize</strong>.
