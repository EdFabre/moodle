            <p>Under the terms and conditions hereinafter set forth, SAS grants 
              to Customer a nonassignable, nontransferable, and nonexclusive license 
              to access and use the Training for the license period selected and 
              paid for by Customer.

              <dd>2.1 Customer will create a profile with a unique password for 
                use in accessing the Training. Customer may not provide the profile 
                information or password to any other individual or entity.

                in effect between Customer and SAS. Customer may not distribute 
                the Training to any third party in modified or unmodified form. 
                Customer may not save and reuse or otherwise access the Training 
                offline. Customer may print screen pages for the individual se 
                of Customer. Customer may not duplicate or reproduce the printed 
                screens or distribute the printed screens to any other individual 
                or entity. Customer agrees to secure and protect the Training 
                in a manner consistent with the maintenance of SAS' rights therein.

          <li><font face=Arial size=2><b>Intellectual Property Rights</b></font> 
            <p>The Training is copyrighted. Title to the Training and all other 
              rights remain with SAS or its licensor(s) at all times. Customer 
              agrees to abide by United States and international copyright laws 
              and treaties, and all other applicable laws and regulations including, 
              but not limited to, export control laws and regulations. SAS reserves 
              the right to update and revise the Training at any time in its sole 
              discretion.
            <p></p>
          <li><font face=Arial size=2><b>Government Use</b></font> 
            <p>Use, duplication, or disclosure of the Training and related documentation 
              by the U.S. Government is subject to this Agreement and the restrictions 
              as set forth in FAR 52.227-19, Commercial Computer Software - Restricted 
              Rights (June 1987). 
            <p></p>
          <li><font face=Arial size=2><b>Export Restrictions</b></font> 
            <p>In addition to the prohibitions set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, 
              Customer may not access, download or otherwise export or reexport 
              the Training or any underlying information or technology except 
              in full compliance with all laws and regulations of the United States 
              of America and in full compliance with any other applicable laws 
              and regulations. Customer affirms that Customer is a lawfully admitted 
              permanent resident of and located in a country to which the United 
              States permits SAS to send the Training. Customer further affirms 
              that Customer is a party to whom the United States allows SAS to 
              license the Training, and Customer is not on any United States Government 
              list of parties to whom SAS may not license the Training, and Customer 
              will not allow any such party to access the Training. The current 
              list of parties to whom SAS may not license the Training includes 
              but is not limited to parties who are involved in terrorism or who 
              will use the Training for design, development, or production of 
              nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons, or missiles.

          <li><font face=Arial size=2><b>Termination</b></font> 
            <p>The Training will be accessible to Customer for the selected license 
              period immediately upon completion of Customer's order. This Agreement 
              governs the use of the Training during all license periods. The 
              license granted under this Agreement automatically terminates upon 
              expiration of the selected license period, at which time the password 
              will no longer operate. Customer may terminate its license for the 
              Training at any time. SAS may terminate the license for a breach 
              of this Agreement. The following sections of this Agreement survive 
              termination or expiration of the license: 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 
              11, 12, and 13.
            <p></p>
          <li><font face=Arial size=2><b>Technical Support</b></font> 
            <p>SAS will use reasonable efforts, either by telephone or in writing 
              to help Customer solve specific problems with use of the Training. 
              It may not be possible to solve all problems or correct all errors 
              in the Training.

              <dd>8.1 SAS warrants that it has the right to license the Training 
                to Customer. The exclusive remedy for breach of this warranty 
                is set forth in Section 10.

                by law, by reason of custom or usage in the trade, or by course 
                of dealing. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the waiver

              the license fees paid by Customer to SAS for the Training during 
              the then-current license period. Because some jurisdictions do not 
              allow the limitation of liability for incidental or consequential

              <dd>10.1 If a claim of copyright, patent, trade secret, or other 
                intellectual property rights violation is made against Customer 
                relating to the Training, Customer agrees to immediately notify 
                SAS, allow SAS to control the litigation or settlement of such 
                claim, and cooperate with SAS in the investigation, defense, and/or 
                settlement thereof. SAS agrees to take control of the litigation 
                and indemnify Customer by paying any settlement approved by SAS, 
                or any judgment, costs, or attorneys' fees finally awarded against 
                Customer for such claim. Customer may participate at Customer's 
                own expense. This indemnification does not apply to the extent 
                the claim is based on a combination of SAS Training with other 
                Training or a Customer modification of the Training if such claim 
                would not have been made but for the combination or modification. 
                <p></p>
              <dd>10.2 If such a claim is made or, in SAS' opinion, is likely 
                to be made, SAS, at its option, may modify the Training, obtain 
                rights for Customer to continue using the Training, or terminate 
                the license for the Training and refund the current license fee 
                paid by Customer. Customer agrees to abide by SAS' decision and, 
                if appropriate, stop using the Training. 
                <p></p>
              </dd>
            </dl>
          <li><font face=Arial size=2><b>Governing Law</b></font> 
            <p>This Agreement is governed by and construed in accordance with 
              the laws of the State of North Carolina, excluding choice of law 
              provisions, and of the United States of America. The parties expressly 
              exclude the application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts 
              for the International Sale of Goods to this Agreement.
            <p></p>
          <li><font face=Arial size=2><b>Complete Agreement</b></font> 
            <p>This Agreement and any invoices relating to the Training constitute 
              the complete agreement between Customer and SAS Institute Inc. related 
              to the Training and supercedes any purchase order, communications, 
              or representations regarding the Training.
            <p></p>
          <li><font face=Arial size=2><b>Miscellaneous</b></font> 
            <p>Failure to require compliance with a part of this Agreement is 
              not a waiver of that part. If a court of competent jurisdiction 
              finds any part of this Agreement unenforceable, that part is excluded, 
              but the rest of this Agreement remains in full force and effect. 
              Any attempt by Customer to transfer or assign this Agreement is 
              void. Any additions or modifications to this Agreement must be approved 
              in writing signed by both parties. Breach of SAS' intellectual property 
              rights will lead to damages not adequately remedied by an award 
              of money; therefore, the parties agree that SAS may protect those 
              intellectual property rights through temporary restraining orders 
              or injunctions, without the obligation of posting bond.</li>
