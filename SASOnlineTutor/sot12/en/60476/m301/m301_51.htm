      <td> <p><strong>Understanding SAS Enterprise Guide Software and SAS Software</strong><br>
          SAS Enterprise Guide is a <a href="m301_2.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">client 
          application</a> that uses the processing power of SAS software. You 
          can use SAS Enterprise Guide to write SAS programs and submit them to 
          SAS for processing. When SAS finishes processing the code, it sends 
          the results and log messages back to SAS Enterprise Guide to be displayed. 
        </p>
        <p><strong>Touring the Programming Windows<br>
          </strong>When you first open SAS Enterprise Guide, you see the <a href="m301_4.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">Project 
          window</a>, <a href="m301_5.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">Task List, 
          and Task Status</a> window open in the workspace. For SAS programming, 
          you will also use the <a href="m301_6.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">Server 
          List</a> and the <a href="m301_7.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">Code Editor</a> 
          window. Although the environment differs from the SAS windowing environment, 
          you will find windows in SAS Enterprise Guide to accomplish your programming 
          tasks. </p>
        <p><strong>Writing and Submitting Code<br>
          </strong>In SAS Enterprise Guide you use the Code Editor to write and 
          <a href="m301_9.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">submit SAS programs</a>. 
          After SAS finishes processing your program, you can <a href="m301_11.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">view 
          the log</a> by double-clicking <strong>Log</strong> in the Project window. 
          If you need to <a href="m301_12.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">edit</a> 
          and <a href="m301_13.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">resubmit</a> your 
          program, you will be prompted whether or not to overwrite the previous 
          results. If you choose not to overwrite the results, a new item for 
          the edited code is added to the project.</p>
        <p><strong>Storing and Accessing Code</strong><br>
            When you write a SAS program by using SAS Enterprise Guide, the program 
            is embedded in the project file. You can <a href="m301_16.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">export 
            a copy of the program</a> to a file to save it. You can also create 
            a pointer to the saved code so that the project file contains a shortcut 
            to the saved file rather than the file itself. You can <a href="m301_18.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">open 
            a stored SAS program</a> by selecting <strong>Insert Code</strong>. 
            This creates a shortcut to the file. You can change the properties 
            of the file to embed it in the project if you don't want your changes 
            to affect the file.</p>
        <p><strong>Working with Results</strong><br>
          SAS Enterprise Guide enables you to <a href="m301_21.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">select 
          result formats</a> (HTML, PDF, RTF, text) to produce from your programs. 
          You can specify result formats for one program by using the Preferences 
          window for that program. You can specify default result formats for 
          all the programs that you run by using the Options window. You can also 
          <a href="m301_23.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">specify the style</a> 
          of your HTML results. </p>
        <p><strong>Working with Data</strong><br>
          SAS Enterprise Guide makes it easy to access data. After you add data 
          to your project, you can view the properties by right-clicking the data 
          in the Project window and selecting <strong>Properties</strong> from 
          the pop-up menu. You can add and open <a href="m301_25.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">SAS 
          data sets</a> and edit them in the data grid. If the data that you add 
          is not located in an active library, SAS Enterprise Guide submits a 
          LIBNAME statement for you. </p>
        <p>In addition to SAS data sets, you can also add <a href="m301_26.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">other 
          types of data</a>. You can use this data as input to tasks and queries, 
          but you cannot modify the data. You can use the Import Data task to 
          create a SAS data set from a Microsoft Excel file or a text file. </p>
        <p><strong>Generating and Editing Task Code<br>
          </strong>SAS Enterprise Guide has point-and-click tasks for many of 
          the SAS procedures that you use in your programs. You can use these 
          tasks to quickly and easily generate SAS programs. If the task window 
          does not have all the options that you want to use, you can edit the 
          generated code and submit it. There are three ways that you can edit 
          task code:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="m301_35.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">Edit a copy</a> of 
            the generated task code.</li>
          <li><a href="m301_37.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">Insert lines of code</a> 
            into the task code.</li>
          <li><a href="m301_39.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">Add code before or 
            after all program or task code</a> that runs in SAS Enterprise Guide. 
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Generating and Editing Query Code<br>
          </strong>In SAS Enterprise Guide, you can use the point-and-click Query 
          Builder to <a href="m301_43.htm" onClick="suggestBack()">generate SQL 
          code</a> that you can edit. When you edit code generated from the Query 
          Builder, the code is separated from the task.<br>

            This creates a shortcut to the file. You can change the properties 
            of the file to embed it in the project if you don't want your changes
